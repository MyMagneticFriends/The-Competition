        <p>  
            It all started with me, a guitar, and a dream. Actually, scratch that—just a guitar and a lot of frustration.  
            <br><br>
            Every Friday, I made the pilgrimage to POK's house, guitars in hand, fingers raw, and expectations high. We weren’t exactly rock gods back in school—our musical peak was smashing piano keys like we were summoning demons.  
            <br><br>
            POK, with his suspiciously abundant free time, was getting *way* better than me. And then, one night, he played an original song that actually slapped. Like, “this-should-be-a-hit” level.  
            <br><br>
            So I did what any supportive friend would do—I *forced* him to record it. That kicked off six months of me fumbling through music production while POK pumped out songs like a discount Bob Dylan.  
            <br><br>
            And thus, *My Magnetic Friends* was born—a chaotic, whiskey-fueled, guitar-infested passion project that’s equal parts music, madness, and questionable decisions.
