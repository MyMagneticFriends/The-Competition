            We’ve been friends since our teenage years, bonding over music in the mosh pits of Vagabonds—where getting an accidental elbow in the face was just part of the charm. Ah, nostalgia.  
            <br><br>
            No screaming guitars for us, though. While others were perfecting power chords, we were learning classical piano, grinding through scales, and preparing for exams—because nothing says “rebellion” like a perfectly executed C major arpeggio.  
            <br><br>
            Years (many years) later, we finally wised up and picked up guitars, powered by the reckless enthusiasm of middle-aged men who really should know better.  
            <br><br>
            One night, something unexpected happened—POK played a song he had written himself. And it was *good*. Like, suspiciously good. The kind of song that makes you wonder if he had been hiding secret musical abilities all along.  
            <br><br>
            I decided we had to record it. Simple, right? Just hit record and boom—instant masterpiece. **Six months later**, we were knee-deep in microphone experiments, watching YouTube tutorials at 2 AM, and arguing over whether distortion made everything sound *better* or just *louder*.  
            <br><br>
            And so, *My Magnetic Friends* was born. Two guys making music, making noise, and making up for lost time.
