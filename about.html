    <div class="content-wrapper">
        <p>  
            Weâ€™ve been friends since we were teenagers, back when we thought learning piano scales would make us cooler. Spoiler alert: it didnâ€™t.  
            <br><br>
            While other kids were shredding guitars and dreaming of rock stardom, we were stuck preparing for piano exams, playing classical pieces instead of the grunge and indie anthems we actually loved.  
            <br><br>
            Fast forward to our late forties, and we finally decided to do something about it. We picked up guitars, cracked open some beers, and tried to recapture the musical energy we never had.  
            <br><br>
            Thatâ€™s when POKâ€”the name, not the guyâ€”threw us a curveball. Turns out, POK are his actual initials from birth, something we only discovered after decades of knowing him. Heâ€™d been using a different name his entire life. Talk about an identity crisis!  
            <br><br>
            Around the same time, life threw him another plot twistâ€”his wife left, taking the kids with her. Suddenly, he had a lot of free time. What better way to fill the void than drowning in guitar riffs and songwriting?  
            <br><br>
            So here we are, two grown men jamming like reckless teens, making up for lost time. *My Magnetic Friends* is the product of that madnessâ€”raw, imperfect, but full of heart.
