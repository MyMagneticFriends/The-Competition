    <div class="content-wrapper">
        <p>  
            We’ve been friends since our teenage years, a love for music born in the mosh pits of Vagabonds. Where aggravated assault was a good time on the dance floor.  
            <br><br>
            No thrashing guitars for us, we both studied classical piano, scales and piano exams—because nothing screams “rebellion” like nailing a C major arpeggio.  
            <br><br>
            Years (many years) later, we finally saw the light and picked up guitars, fueled by the reckless enthusiasm of men who should probably know better.  
            <br><br>
            One night, something unexpected happened—POK played a song he had written himself. And it was *good*. Like, suspiciously good. The kind of song that makes you wonder if he had been hiding secret musical abilities all along.  
            <br><br>
            I decided we had to record it. Simple, right? Just hit record and boom—instant masterpiece. **Six months later**, we were knee-deep in microphone experiments, watching YouTube tutorials at 2 AM, and arguing over whether distortion made everything sound *better* or just *louder*.  
            <br><br>
            And so, *My Magnetic Friends* was born. Two guys making music, making noise, and making up for lost time.
