    <h1><span>ABOUT</span> <span class="flicker">My Magnetic Friends</span></h1>
    
    <p>  
        So there I was, religiously making my way over to POK's house every Friday, guitars in hand, pretending we were rockstars and conveniently ignoring how much our fingers hurt.  
        <br><br>
        We had never been the "cool kids with a band" in school—our musical talents back then maxed out at some aggressively enthusiastic piano playing.  
        <br><br>
        POK, having more free time (and apparently a secret songwriting superpower), had been making way more progress than me. One fateful night, he played an original song that was actually *good*. Like, "why-is-this-not-on-the-radio" good.  
        <br><br>
        So naturally, I did what any good friend would do—I *stole* his talent. Not really, but I did decide that this needed to be recorded and shared with the world.  
        <br><br>
        Thus began a six-month odyssey of microphone experiments, accidental deafness, and my crash course in music production. Meanwhile, POK kept churning out songs like some kind of indie rock wizard.  
        <br><br>
        And that’s how "My Magnetic Friends" came to be—a chaotic, whiskey-fueled, guitar-infested passion project that started as two guys trying (and failing) to jam properly.
